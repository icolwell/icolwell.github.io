Hi There! I created this blog after realizing my collection of sloppily-recorded
instructions for various software related things needed to be organized better.
This means you the reader can benefit off of any issues that I may have solved
already. I hope that my content can help other people out there either get
things working, or understand things better. What usually motivates me to write
new post is the lack of existing material on the subject, or the lack of a
detailed explanation.

I typically write posts on the following subjects:
- Instructions for installing/configuring software
- Debugging software issues
- Explanations of how things work from a beginner perspective
